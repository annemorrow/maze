# Math Maze

This program will use javascript to create a maze that can be explored in the browser.  The program will also create blocking elements that can be removed by answering a question that appears in a popup window when the exploring element touches the blocking element.  The question options will be multiplication, fractions, and other math topics.

#### Possible extensions

Build a backend that allows teachers to create profiles and upload their own question sets.
